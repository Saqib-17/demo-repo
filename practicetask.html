            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently working on my <strong>portfolio</strong> website, 
                    which will showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments. 
                    This site will serve as my <em>professional online presence</em>, 
                    helping me to highlight my <strong>expertise</strong> and attract potential 
                    clients or employers.

                <h3>My projects</h3>
                <p >
                    Iâ€™m crafting a dynamic portfolio website that will illuminate 
                    my skills, projects, and achievements like a digital gallery. 
                    This virtual space will not only showcase my professional journey 
                    but also draw in potential clients and employers with its creative 
                    flair and compelling content.
